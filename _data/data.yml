    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I finished High school "Mihajlo Pupin" in Kula in 2014.
      Since then I was working at many factories in Slovakia like a Foxconn, Samsung and Volkswagen. 
      I have worked in multiple positions such as manufacturing worker, mechanical technician.
      My work responsibilities were for example: assembling, repairing, packing and controlling products.
      After two years of working in those jobs, I felt the need to change my job because 
      I wanted to do something different and more challenging, and that’s when I decided to go into chef training.
      After training as a chef I went to a new destination,
      ie. I found a job as an assistant cook at the Parentium Hotel in Poreč.
      The job of assistant cook was very exciting,creative and dynamic.
      My work assignments were very diverse and responsible.While working in the kitchen,
      I learned a lot about cooking and not only that, but also how to be more patient, considerate,
      and more enduring in sensitive moments.After two years of working as an assistant chef, 
      I feel again saturated with my current occupation and want to do something even more challenging and creative.
      I decided to start learning programming because I believe it is an occupation that will allow me 
      to do something creative and exciting while having a family. I started learning the basics of programming,
      Html and Css and when I learned that I would start learning javascript 
      and other necessary knowledge to become a successful web developer. My goal is to get it done as soon as possible.
